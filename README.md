# Contacts
A program that allows the user to add contacts to a list of contacts and then creates a JSON file with said list. Also, it allows the user to read the information of a particular contact by providing their name and surname.

The idea of this project is to practice creating JSON files, as well as recovering data from them and showing some specific part of it.
